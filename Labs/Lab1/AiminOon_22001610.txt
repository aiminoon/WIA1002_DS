My name is Dennis Aimin Oon bin Jeffrey Oon with matrix number, 22001610. I am majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject. This is because I enjoy problem solving and want to strengthen my programming fundamentals.

I acquired a decent grade for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get a good grade for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will stay consistent with my practice and actively participate in class. Wish me luck!!!

My name is Dennis Aimin Oon bin Jeffrey Oon with matrix number, 22001610. I am majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is my first time enrolling in the Data Structure course, and I feel genuinely excited about it. I believe data structures can be engaging and enjoyable to learn.

Previously, I did fairly well in the Programming I course, which helped build my confidence. I learned a lot and believe I can improve even more this semester. Iâ€™m determined to give my best in this subject and strive for a great result. Wish me luck!
